This project aims to fully implement the FIGfont spec in JavaScript.

You can see it in action here: http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ (the figlet.js file was written to power that application)

The examples folder in this project shows how to use the figlet.js file for node.js and in the browser.

The doc/figfont.txt file in this project contains the FIGlet FIGfont spec.
