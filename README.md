This project aims to fully implement the FIGfont spec in JavaScript.

You can see it in action here: http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ (the figlet.js file was written to power that application)

The index.html file in this project shows how to use the figlet.js file.

The figfont.txt file in this project contains the FIGlet FIGfont spec.

If you're looking for FIGlet fonts, a repo of them is maintained here:
